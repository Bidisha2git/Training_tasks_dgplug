Introduction

--------------

I am Bidisha Mukherjee.I am during my B.Tech in Computer science and Engineering from Dr.B.C.Roy Engineering College, Durgapur.

The Summer Training 2013 at #dgplug channel is a very nice way to introduce people like us to the a new language and use the computer as it should be used by an engineer. Sometimes I feel lack of information that leads me to commit a number of mistakes. But later on this in turn helps me to learn from my mistake and helps me to rectify them.

Thank you all those who have taken this initiative to conduct this Summer Training at #dgplug.
